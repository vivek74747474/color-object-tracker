Color Object Tracker (OpenCV)

This Python project uses OpenCV to detect and track a specific colored object (green) in real time using a webcam

How It Works
- Captures video from webcam
- Converts each frame to HSV
- Applies color mask to isolate object
- Detects contours and draws a box around the detected object

Output Example
<img src="demo.png" alt="demo screenshot" width="500"/>
